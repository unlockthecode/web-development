## 📚 Purpose

To organize and track everything I learn as I explore web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

## 🧠 What You'll Find

- Structured notes and summaries from tutorials and courses
- Practice projects and coding exercises
- Personal problems and solutions I've tackled
- Dedicated Folders for each course I've learnt (e.g. `html-davegray/`, `fullstack-scrimba/`, etc.)

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm currently learning:
- ✅ HTML Course by Dave Gray ([see my notes](./html-davegray/README.md))
- ⏳ Fullstack Developer from Scratch by Scrimba ([see my notes](./fullstack-scrimba/README.md))

## 🛠 Tech Stack (so far)

- Visual Studio Code
- Live Server
- HTML, CSS
- Browser DevTools

## 📌 Notes

Everything in this repository reflects my personal learning progress. It may not be best practice or production-ready code — it's a work-in-progress portfolio of what I'm studying.
